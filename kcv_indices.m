% (in) and to be left out (out).
%
% The sample of size n (number of elements in 'ind') is partitioned
% into K random folds to be sequentially left out in K-fold cross
% validation. The folds to be left out for verification have approximately
%  equal size. [Precisely, the first m=mod(n,K) folds have size l+1, the
% remaining folds size l, where l=floor(n/K).] Each CV sample
% in{1:K} is of size nin{1:K}.

% [in, out, nin] = KCV_INDICES(ind, K, mode) specifies the mode of
% cross-validation. Possible values:
%  - 'blinds' ("Venetian blinds") resulting from K random
%      partitions of the n rows (generally not contiguous)  [default]
%  - 'blocks' resulting from K contiguous subdivisions of the 1:n interval.
